# My Portfolio

## Why have a Portfolio?

My dream is to become a full stack web developer :stars:

I'm currently undergoing training through a coding boot camp collaborated by University of Sydney and Trilogy Education.

This portfolio is a way to showcase what I've learnt and put in the practice by demonstrating those skills.

The goal is to improve this portfolio as I progress and apply any new things I've learnt.

## What Have I learnt so far? (Updated 9/12/2021)
