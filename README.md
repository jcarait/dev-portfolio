# My Portfolio

## Why have a Portfolio?

My dream is to become a full stack web developer :stars:

I'm currently undergoing training through a coding boot camp collaborated by University of Sydney and Trilogy Education.

This portfolio is a way to showcase what I've learnt with CSS and hopefully improve upon it as I learn more new things.

## What Have I learnt so far? (Updated 9/12/2021)

- HTML5 Structure, semantics, containers
- Advanced CSS including but not limited to: Media Queries, Flexbox, Backgrounds

### Features

- Mobile-First CSS Design
- Hero (Background)
- Avatar with container (use of overflow:hidden)
- Link to most recent project (html/css code refactor)
- Common usage of Flexbox
- SVG Icons
